# **Discover Ireland** #

## **Introduction** ##

The Discover Ireland website was created and built by Stephen Mc Govern. The aim of the website is to provide people who are thinking of visiting Dublin, Cork or Galway with some information on each city and to help them decide which city they may prefer to visit.

Each city page has the same structure so users will be familiar with the layout if they are browsing all 3 cities. Each page gives a brief overview of the cities history, a short video from the tourist board of each city, a google map with a drop down menu providing some recommendations for categories of Hotels, Bars, Restaurants and Tourist Attractions. I also added an "Our top recommendations" section for places i think a tourist would definitely want to visit while in each city.

**ADDITIONAL FEATURES**

I also wanted users to the site to be able to price and book flights. View and book accommodation, restaurants, and tourist attractions. Some additional features i also added were:

1. A weather widget at the top of each page that gives an animated live 7 day forecast of the weather in each city. The weather in Ireland changes regularly and we often have 4 season in one day. This little feature will allow any user to check the next 7 days weather at a glance. 
2. A Skyscanner widget that is already preset to the nearest airport of each city. Users only need to enter their airport of origin and the dates they wish to travel and Skyscanner will provide them with a list of available flights. At the time of completing this project (April 2021)the Skyscanner widget is also incorporating a Covid-19 travel advice link as this information is also very important to any traveller wishing to book a flight on an airplane. 
3. Finally at the bottom of each page i have added a contact form that is powered by Email JS. When a user submits a message to the site i as the site owner will receive an email notification. The user will also receive an automated email reply confirming there message has been received and that we will be contacting them shortly to answer their enquiry.

## **1. User Experience (UX)** ##

### **1.1 - Target Audience** ###

* This website is aimed at anyone who is thinking of, or who has already organized a trip to visit the Irish cities of Dublin, Cork or Galway. 

### **1.2 - Visitor goals** ###

As a potential visitor to the city i want to be able to find out a few different things. 

1. How can i get to the cities from overseas? So flight information is one thing i need. 
2. I want to be able to see options for hotels, restaurants, bars, and tourist attractions. 
3. As ive never been to the city before I would also like some recommendations from the people who run the website as they would have an idea of the things a visitor should see. 
4. Finally i want to be able to contact the people who run the website just incase i have any questions if needed. 

### **1.3 - User Stories** ###

**As a visitor to Discover Ireland i want/expect/need:**

* A simple user friendly site where i can get a brief overview of the city i am thinking of visiting. I want the layout of the site to be simple and to make sense so I am not confused or put off using it.
* I want the information I am presented with to be laid out in a way that is easy for me to navigate.
* I want the site to provide me with the contact details such as: phone number, address, email, website, and a google map location for things that they are recommending that i should see/do when im in the city.
* I hear the weather in Ireland is something that can change from day to day, i would also like to know a bit more about the weather conditions of each city before i visit so i can plan accordingly.
* I may be viewing the site several time for information, i will more than likely be viewing the site from a mobile phone or tablet. I want the site to have been designed responsively so that it is still easy to navigate and use on my mobile devices.
* I also expect to be able to connect to the sites social media channels with a simple click so i can keep up to date with anything that the site admins may post there. 
* Finally as a user I expect feedback from the website I am using when I interact with it. If i send a message to the website i would like a confirmation that my message has been sent successfully. 


### **User Experience Walk through** ### 

This user lands on the Discover Ireland homepage. They are thinking of doing a short weekend city break to Dublin next weekend with a group of their friends. On the landing page they see they have 3 options ot choose from. As the user is thinking of visiting Dublin they click on the Dublin option as this is the visit they want to find out more information about. 

![Image of homepage / splash page](assets/readme-images/splash-page.png)

When the page opens the user can clearly see the Navbar at the top of the page that immediately tells them the sections they can expect to find on this page. They can also see a weather widget with a live 7 day animated forecast at the top of the page. This is very handy as the user is thinking of visiting next weekend so at a glance they can see the weather next weekend. They can also look through the images of Dublin on the Photo carousel. The use of great imagery produces a positive user response on any website. 

![Image of Dublin page with Navbar and Weather widget](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-1.png)

The user has never been to Dublin before so they scroll to the about Dublin page. Here they can read a small overview of the city.

![Image of the about Dublin section](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-2.png)

As the user will be flying into Dublin from the UK they want to know a bit more about the airport. They can see from the information provide that Dublin Airport is located 20/30 minutes from the city centre. The user can also see that the site has incorporated a Skyscanner widget into it. 

![Image of the getting here Dublin section](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-3.png)

The user can also see that the closest airport to the city has already been pre-populated for them, so they only need to enter their airport of origin and the dates they are looking to travel. The user can also see that the skyscanner widget predictively lists all of the airports as they begin to type London, a nice addition that will save them some extra clicks. 

![Image of the getting here Dublin section](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-4.png)

Now the user has entered their flight information into the widget they can press "Search Flights". Dublin was already pre-populated as the arrival airport so great that i didn't have to input that myself. 

![Image of the getting here Dublin section](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-5.png)

After the user presses search flights, as expected they can see they are brought to the skyscanner page where they can adjust the filter's they i need to price and book flights. But the user will come back to that later.

![Image of Skyscanner page user is diverted too](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-6.png)

The user is wondering what can they and their friends do in Dublin. They can see that rather than have to read through endless lines of text there is a short video on the city that they can watch. The video is hosted on a simple Video JS player with basic controls which the majority of users will be very familiar with (No need to over complicate things with lots of controls). The videos are all around 1 and a half minutes long, great, its nice and short so the user can watch all of it without getting board or distracted. 

![Image of the things to do video section](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-7.png)

After watching the video the user is impressed with what looks to be a wide range of activities to do in the city. They can also see that Dublin seems to have a lot going on and it is not just a city for visitors who wish to come and drink in a pub. 

The user can see below the video there is a Google Map of Dublin being displayed. This again is something the user is very familiar with as Google maps are pretty much the standard on most websites. The user clicks on the local recommendations button.

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-8.png)

The user sees that they can select a number of categories. Lets start with finding a place to stay. The user clicks on Hotels and the map has generated a range of hotels that go from 5 star to hostel, a nice feature that will show the user a range of hotels for each price point. 

After clicking on all the accommodation choices listed the user sees that there is an award winning hostel listed thats right in the heart of the city. The user can see the hostels phone number, its address, phone number, and also read that its an award winning hostel, this looks like the one the user will go for.  

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-9.png)

After clicking the "Website here" link in the information box the user is brought to the homepage of the Generator Hostel in a new tab that has opened. Great, now the user can enter the dates they are looking to stay and also enter the number of people traveling so they can get a quote for the accommodation. 

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-10.png)

Couple this with the skyscanner widget the user can now start to put costings in place as they know what flights and accommodation will cost.

Upon scrolling a bit further down the page the user sees that the site operator has listed some of their own top recommendations. This always creates a positive user experience as when visiting a new city you are always on the look out for the best hidden spots. The user can see there is a pub listed, a coffee shop, a sushi restaurant and also a recommendation for the guinness storehouse. 

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-11.png)

At the bottom of the page the user sees that there is a contact form they can use to message the site admin. A handy little tool, for now though the user has a good mix of information that they can go back to show their friends so they can decide what they will be booking in terms of flights and accommodation. 

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-12.png)

Before the user closes the site they go back to the Google map as they remember that there different categories listed. They can see after clicking through the categories that there is a range of different bars, restaurants and tourist attractions listed. 

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-13.png)

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-14.png)

![Image of the google map with local recommendations](assets/readme-images/dublin-user-stories-15.png)

The user will look at these options with their friends before booking their trip so they have a shortlist of places drawn up before they arrive. 

### **1.4 - Design Choices** ###

* I wanted the website to be very visual and not just a lot of text. Therefore I have incorporated a lot of imagery on each page, inserted weather and flights widgets, videos and google maps with places/location markers for each map. 

**FONTS**

* For the website i decided to use the google font style of Forum. Forum has antique, classic "Roman" proportions. It can be used to set body texts and works well in titles and headlines too. It is truly multilingual, with glyphs for Central and Eastern Europe, Baltics, Cyrillic and Asian Cyrillic communities. The link to the Forum font on Google Font can be found by clicking: [Here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Forum?preview.text_type=custom#glyphs)

**ICONS**

* I also decided to incorporate some icons throughout the website. I did this because icons give a more visually pleasing experience for the user and also relate to the type of information that they are looking at. I also incorporated social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube) that are located in the footer of the page.

* Some of the icons on the site were taken from the Font Awesome website. The link to the Font Awesome website can be found by clicking: [Here](https://fontawesome.com/)

* The icons i used for markers on the Google Map page were icons that come from map icons collection. They have a wide range of icons that you can customize in terms of design and colour. The link to these icons can be found [Here](https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/category/markers/) 

**COLOURS**

* I used the website colour mind when deciding on which colours to use. The website uses a generator to help you select the best matching colour palettes for your project. The website can be found by clicking this link: [Here](http://colormind.io/)

* For the base colours i decided to go with the following colour palette 

![Image of the primary colour pallet used for the project](assets/readme-images/primary-colours.png)

* The reason for this particular pallet is because these are the colours for each city. 

  #FF0000 & #FFFFFF are the colours of Cork<br>
  #9C0404 & #FFFFFF are the colours od Galway

* Dublin's official colour is #040484 which is a navy blue, however the initial feedback i got from people who viewed the early site was that as the site is a guide to Irish cities they would have liked, and expected to see a lot more green. Therefore i decided to make the Dublin page a mix of 

  #124624 (Green) & FFFFFF (White) <br>
  #9D9D9D (Silver/Grey) is used as the border on several items on the page. 

* I also went for a secondary colour palette for more minor touches on the site. These colours can be seen below:

![Image of the secondary colour pallet used for the project](assets/readme-images/secondary-colours.png)

## **2. Features** ##

I have created the website so all of the city pages have the exact same features. I did this because i wanted the users to have the same features on every page so no matter what city they were thinking of visiting, the layout and features will be the same to help with user experience. The breakdown of the features on each page are listed below: 

### **2.1 - The Navbar** ###

For the Navbar i decided to use a standard Bootstrap 4.4 Navbar. I chose this option because i wanted the Navbar to be responsive on all screen sizes and bootstrap offers this easily. 

![Image of Navbar](assets/readme-images/navbar.png)

The Navbar on each page is standardized, the link to the homepage is located on the top left hand side, on the right hand side we have 

1. About City
2. Getting Here 
3. Things To Do
4. Contact Us

On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar items.

![Image of Navbar as hamburger menu](assets/readme-images/hamburger-navbar.png)

### **2.2 - JavaScript weather widget** ###

Below the Navbar i have installed a weather widget that will display an animated 7 day forecast. This will display the weather for each city when the user is on the page. I have also set this so the background will reflect the current weather conditions and whether it is night or day. The widget is also responsive and will adjust depending on screen size.

![Image of Navbar as hamburger menu](assets/readme-images/weather-widget.png)

### **2.3 - Photo Carousel** ###

I wanted to use some great images on the website. To achieve this i have used a bootstrap carousel to show several different images of each city to users. The photos are also set to auto scroll and at the footer of the images there is some text that describes what each image is. 

![Image of Photo Carousel](assets/readme-images/photo-carousel.png)

### **2.4 - SkyScanner JavaScript Widget** ###

I have also installed a Skyscanner widget on the website. This will allow users of the site to enter the city they are flying from, the dates they are looking to fly, and when the click on search flights Skyscanner will give them flight availability and prices. As the site isn't an integrated partner booking a flight on the site isn't possible, instead the user is diverted to the Skyscanner page.

![Image of Photo Carousel](assets/readme-images/skyscanner-widget.png)

### **2.5 - Video JS** ###

I wanted to use as wide a range of options as possible to display information to users. People engage with video a lot more than they do with just pages and pages of text. Because of this on every city page i have created a video player that will play a short video from the local tourist board that will show users some of the tings they can expect to see/do in each city.

![Image of video player](assets/readme-images/city-video.png)

### **2.6 - Google Maps API** ###

I have added a Google Map to each city page. Users can click on the dropdown menu and select which category they are looking for recommendations for.

![Google Map image with markers hotels selected](assets/readme-images/google-map-with-markers.png)

To activate the functionality for these Google map i needed to generate an API key on the Google maps dashboard. To secure this API from being copied and used by other people i have restricted its use in my Google maps dashboard. 

### **2.7 - Contact Us Forum** ###

At the bottom of every page i have placed a contact us form where users can send emails direct to us. The contact us form has Email JS operating on the backend. Once a user clicks ont he send message button an alert will populate to show the user the message was sent. Email JS will also send an auto reply to the user to let them know their message was successfully received and that we will be back in contact with them.

I have also created a caps lock notification for the email input so the user will get a pop up alert if they have caps lock on when they try and enter their email address. 

![Image of contact us form](assets/readme-images/contact-us-form.png)

### **2.8 - The Footer** ###

In the footer i have listed all of the companies social media links. As with the navbar, the footer is identical on each page to maintain consistency no matter what page the user finds themselves on.

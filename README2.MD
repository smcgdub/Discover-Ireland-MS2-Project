# **Discover Ireland** #
![Image of Irish Flag](assets/readme-images/irish-flag.jpg)

## **Introduction** ##

The Discover Ireland website was created and built by Stephen Mc Govern. The aim of the website is to provide people who are thinking of visiting Dublin, Cork or Galway with some information on each city and to help them decide which city they may prefer to visit.

Each city page has the same structure so users will be familiar with the layout if they are browsing all 3 cities. Each page gives a brief overview of the cities history, a short video from the tourist board of each city, a google map with a drop down menu providing some recommendations for categories of Hotels, Bars, Restaurants and Tourist Attractions. I also added an "Our top recommendations" section for places i think a tourist would definitely want to visit while in each city.

**ADDITIONAL FEATURES** 

Some of the additional features i added were:

1. A weather widget at the top of each page that gives a live 7 day forecast of the weather in each city.
2. A Skyscanner widget that is preset tot he nearest airport of each city. Users just need ot enter their origin city and the dates they wish to travel and Skyscanner will provide them with a list of available flights. At the time of completing this project (April 2021) the Skyscanner widget is also incorporating a Covid-19 travel advice link as this information is also very important to any traveller wishing to book a flight on an airplane. 
3. At the bottom of each page i have added a contact form that is powered by Email JS. When a user submits a message to the site i as the site owner will receive an email notification. The user will also receive an automated email reply confirming there message has been received and that we will be contacting them shortly to answer their enquiry.

## **1. User Experience (UX)** ##

### **1.1 - Target Audience** ###

* This website is aimed at anyone who is thinking of, or who has already organized a trip to visit the Irish cities of Dublin, Cork or Galway. 

### **1.2 - Visitor goals** ###

* As a potential visitor to the city i want to be able to find out a few different things. 

1. How can i get here from overseas? So flight information is one thing i need. 
2. I also want to be able to see options for hotels, restaurants,bars, cafe's and tourist attractions. As ive never been to the city before i would also like some recommendations from the people who run the website. 
3. Finally i want to be able to contact the people who run the website so i can ask them further questions if needed. 

### **1.3 - User Stories** ###

*

### **1.4 - Design Choices** ###

* I wanted the website to be very visual and not just a lot of text. Therefore I have incorporated a lot of imagery on each page, inserted weather and flights widgets, YouTube videos and google maps with places/location markers for each map. 

**FONTS**

* For the website i decided to use the google font style of Forum. Forum has antique, classic "Roman" proportions. It can be used to set body texts and works well in titles and headlines too. It is truly multilingual, with glyphs for Central and Eastern Europe, Baltics, Cyrillic and Asian Cyrillic communities. The link to the Forum font on Google Font can be found by clicking: [Here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Forum?preview.text_type=custom#glyphs)

**ICONS**

* I also decided to incorporate some icons throughout the website. I did this because icons give a more visually pleasing experience for the user and also relate to the type of information that they are looking at. I also incorporated social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube) that are located in the footer of the page.

* Some of the icons on the site were taken from the Font Awesome website. The link to the Font Awesome website can be found by clicking: [Here](https://fontawesome.com/)

* The icons i used for markers on the Google Map page were icons that come from Google Earth. The link to these icons can be found [Here](http://kml4earth.appspot.com/icons.html) 

**COLOURS**

* I used the website colour mind when deciding on which colours to use. The website uses a generator to help you select the best matching colour palettes for your project. The website can be found by clicking this link: [Here](http://colormind.io/)

* For the base colours i decided to go with the following colour palette 

![Image of the primary colour pallet used for the project](assets/readme-images/primary-colours.png)

* The reason for this particular pallet is because these are the colours for each city. 

  #FF0000 & #FFFFFF are the colours of Cork<br>
  #9C0404 & #FFFFFF are the colours od Galway

* Dublin's official colour is #040484 which is a navy blue, however the initial feedback i got from people who viewed the early site was that as the site is a guide to Irish cities they would have liked, and expected to see a lot more green. Therefore i decided to make the Dublin page a mix of 

  #124624 (Green) & FFFFFF (White) <br>
  #9D9D9D is used as the border on several items on the page. 

* I also went for a secondary colour palette for more minor touches on the site. These colours can be seen below:

## **2. Features** ##

I have created the website so all of the city pages have the exact same features. I did this because i wanted the users to have the same features on every page so no matter what city they were thinking of visiting, the layout and features will be the same to help with user experience. The breakdown of the features on each page are listed below: 

### **2.1 - The Navbar** ###

For the Navbar i decided to use a standard Bootstrap 4.4 Navbar. I chose this option because i wanted the Navbar to be responsive on all screen sizes and bootstrap offers this easily. 

![Image of Navbar](assets/readme-images/navbar.png)

The Navbar on each page is standardized, the link to the homepage is located on the top left hand side, on the right hand side we have 

1. About City
2. Getting Here 
3. Things To Do
4. Contact Us

On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar items.

![Image of Navbar as hamburger menu](assets/readme-images/hamburger-navbar.png)

### **2.2 - JavaScript weather widget** ###

Below the Navbar i have installed a weather widget that will display an animated 7 day forecast. This will display the weather for each city when the user is on the page. I have also set this so the background will reflect the current weather conditions and whether it is night or day. The widget is also responsive and will adjust depending on screen size.

![Image of Navbar as hamburger menu](assets/readme-images/weather-widget.png)

### **2.3 - Photo Carousel** ###

I wanted to use some great images on the website. To achieve this i have used a bootstrap carousel to show several different images of each city to users. The photos are also set to auto scroll and at the footer of the images there is some text that describes what each image is. 

![Image of Photo Carousel](assets/readme-images/photo-carousel.png)

### **2.4 - SkyScanner JavaScript Widget** ###

I have also installed a Skyscanner widget on the website. This will allow users of the site to enter the city they are flying from, the dates they are looking to fly, and when the click on search flights Skyscanner will give them flight availability and prices. As the site isnt an integrated partner booking a flight on the site isnt possible, instead the user is diverted to the Skyscanner page.

![Image of Photo Carousel](assets/readme-images/skyscanner-widget.png)

### **2.5 - YouTube API videos** ###

I wanted to use as wide a range of options as possible to display information to users. On every city page i have created a YouTube video that gives a very short introduction about each city. This was done using the YouTube API. 

![Image of YouTube video](assets/readme-images/youtube.png)

### **2.6 - Google Maps API** ###

I have added a Google Map to each city page. Users can click on the dropdown menu and select which category they are looking for recommendations for.

![Google Map image with markers hotels selected](assets/readme-images/google-map-with-markers.png)

### **2.7 - Contact Us Forum** ###

At the bottom of every page i have placed a contact us form where users can send emails direct to us. The contact us form has Email JS operating on the backend. Once a user clicks ont he send message button an alert will populate to show the user the message was sent. Email JS will also send an auto reply to the user to let them know their message was successfully received and that we will be back in contact with them.

![Image of contact us form](assets/readme-images/contact-us-form.png)

### **2.8 - The Footer** ###

In the footer i have listed all of the companies social media links. As with the navbar, the footer is identical on each page to maintain consistency no matter what page the user finds themselves on.
